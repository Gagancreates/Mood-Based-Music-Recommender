## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **MongoDB** (running locally) - [Download here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project root and install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Add Audio Files

This is the **MOST IMPORTANT** step! Add your MP3 files to the `backend/public/audio/` directory:

```bash
backend/public/audio/
├── happy1.mp3
├── happy2.mp3
├── happy3.mp3
├── sad1.mp3
├── sad2.mp3
├── sad3.mp3
├── romantic1.mp3
├── romantic2.mp3
├── romantic3.mp3
├── energetic1.mp3
├── energetic2.mp3
└── energetic3.mp3
```

**Important Notes:**
- You need to provide your own MP3 files (3 songs per mood = 12 total)
- Name them exactly as shown above, or update the seed script accordingly
- Use royalty-free music or music you have rights to use
- Each file should be a 30-60 second preview for best user experience

**Where to find free music:**
- [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)
- [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/)
- [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/)
- [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary)

### Step 3: Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine:

```bash
# On macOS (with Homebrew)
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Windows (run as service or manually)
mongod

# On Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

Verify MongoDB is running by checking:
```bash
mongosh
# or
mongo
```

### Step 4: Seed the Database

Run the seed script to populate MongoDB with song metadata:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

### Step 5: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### Step 6: Start the Frontend

Open a **new terminal** window/tab:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
